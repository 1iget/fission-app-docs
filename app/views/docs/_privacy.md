Heavy Water may provide you the opportunity to pay subscription fees or other payments through the Services.  Heavy Water
contracts with third-party service providers for payment services (the “Payment Providers”).  Heavy Water does not collect
or store your credit card information in connection with these transactions.  By using the online payment option, you provide
your information directly to the Payment Providers, and are subject to their privacy policies and terms and conditions.
If you have questions regarding your transaction, please review the Payment Providers’ polices and terms or contact them directly.
Heavy Water is not responsible for the actions of the Payment Providers, including their use or disclosure of Personal Information.  
Heavy Water uses third-party service providers for the infrastructure required to run the Services (including hardware, software,
networking, and data storage).  Heavy Water encourages you to review the privacy statements of those third-party service providers
so that you can understand how they collect, use and share Your Information. Heavy Water and its representatives are not
responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites or services outside of the Services.

## USE OF COOKIES {#use-of-cookies}

Heavy Water may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned
to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the
web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the Services through your Account, or register
with the Services, a cookie helps the Services to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the processing
of your information. When you return to the Services, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use
the features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
interactive features of the Services.  The Services do not respond to Do Not Track settings.

### OTHER USES OF COOKIES {#other-uses-of-cookies}

Cookies are also a delicious snack, best enjoyed with a glass of milk. Delicious cookies were used in the making of the Services,
but they have nothing to do with our Privacy Policy. These are just facts we thought we should share as a public service announcement.

## DATA RIGHTS AND SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION {#data-rights-and-security-of-your-information}

You are responsible for safeguarding and preventing unauthorized access to your Account and the password that you use to access
the Services. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and you are responsible for any activity using your
account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You must immediately notify Heavy Water of any unauthorized use of your
Account. Heavy Water secures Your Information on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  When Your Information is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through
the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

You retain full ownership in and to all data (including Your Information) entered into the Services, and any and all outputs
generated by your use of the Services, subject to Heavy Water’s rights as described by this Privacy Policy and the Website
Terms of Service.  Your Information will not be made available at any time to any other user of the Service, unless you choose
otherwise. You may choose to transmit, post, or otherwise disclose outputs generated by your use of the Services at your discretion.
Heavy Water will only disclose such outputs as instructed by you through your use of the Services.

In an effort to provide value to all users, Heavy Water and certain third parties it contracts with maintain the right to use and present
Your Information in an aggregated form reflecting combined data from multiple users for statistical reporting purposes only.  Information
collected by Heavy Water may be used for the purpose of identifying industry benchmarks, trends, and evaluating how to improve the Services
for the benefit of all users. Presentation of aggregated information will not reveal data that links to identifying Personal Information
for any user.
